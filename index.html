    <h2>Grunge Alternative music at its best and its core</h2>
    <p>NOTE: This band's music is what I love, the riffs, lyrics, harmonies, and drum beats really move me.
    Much of their music represents their struggles of addiction. Unfortunately 2 members have lost their lives due to this disease. This site's owner strictly loves their music and wishes anyone who fights the battles of addiction to seek help. If Layne would have overcome his addiction, then we might have been blessed with more of his voice.<p>
    <p>Also, this is my first web page created. It is for a homework assigment from UNC Bootcamp. I know it's not stellar (probably a little over-colored), but it's a start, and it's mine.  All created by yours truly.<p>

    <p>Founding member</p>
        <p>Jerry Cantrell served as the lead guitarist, co-lyricist, co-vocalist and main composer of Alice in Chains until the group's near-permanent hiatus beginning in the late 1990s and leading through the death of lead singer Layne Staley in April 2002. Cantrell's guitar contribution gave a heavy metal edge to the band's basic grunge style.</p>
